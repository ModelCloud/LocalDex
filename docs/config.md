## Lifecycle hooks

Admins can set top-level `allow_managed_hooks_only = true` in
`requirements.toml` to ignore user, project, and session hook configs while
still allowing managed hooks from requirements and managed config layers. This
setting is only supported in `requirements.toml`; putting it in `config.toml`
does not enable managed-hooks-only mode.

## MultiDex providers

MultiDex registers an `openrouter` provider by default: it points at
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` and reads its credential only from
`experimental_bearer_token` in `CODEX_HOME/config.toml` — provider API keys
never come from environment variables. No keys are stored in the repo.

```toml
[model_providers.openrouter]
experimental_bearer_token = "sk-or-..."
```

OpenRouter provider routing is configured through the `provider` table on the
provider entry and is forwarded verbatim as the request's top-level `provider`
object:

```toml
model_provider = "openrouter"
model = "deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017"

[model_providers.openrouter.provider]
only = ["wafer/mxfp4"]
allow_fallbacks = false
```

The bundled catalog already includes `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017`
(context window, reasoning levels, and its DeepSeek-tuned system prompt), so
models served through OpenRouter work without a remote model catalog.

Selecting this slug chooses the built-in `openrouter` provider at startup or
during a live model switch. Selecting `DS v4.1 Flash 1017` chooses the local
provider; selecting a bundled OpenAI model from OpenRouter returns to OpenAI.
Managed provider restrictions still apply.

Both DS entries default to Max reasoning and use the same prompt adapted from
DeepSeek Harness's `snapshots/session/worktree/system-prompt.expected.md`.
The adaptation replaces Harness-only file, background-job, goal, and delegation
tools with MultiDex equivalents; it is not a byte-for-byte copy. Explicit
user-configured instructions can still override the model's default prompt.

### Lithos

The built-in provider ID is `lithos`. Its credential also comes only from
`experimental_bearer_token` in `CODEX_HOME/config.toml`, never the environment:

```toml
[model_providers.lithos]
experimental_bearer_token = "lith_..."
```

It uses a native transport adapter
for `https://api.lithosai.cloud/v1/chat/completions`, without a local proxy.
MultiDex keeps upstream conversation construction and converts only the HTTP
request and streamed response at the provider boundary.

```toml
model_provider = "lithos"
model = "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash"
model_reasoning_effort = "max"
```

The canonical display name across providers is **DeepSeek v4.1 Flash**.
Provider-specific wire IDs remain distinct:

| Provider | Speed | Wire model ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local | Regular | `DS v4.1 Flash 1017` |
| OpenRouter | Regular | `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash-1017` |
| Lithos | Regular | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash` |
| Lithos | Fast | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-fast` |
| Lithos | Ultra | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-ultra` |

All entries select the 1017 revision. Lithos's IDs omit the revision suffix;
do not invent an extra suffix in API requests. Reasoning is `off`, `low`,
`high`, or `max`; `off` maps to Lithos's `none` value. Regular is the default
serving variant; faster variants require an explicit model selection.

The adapter preserves text, reasoning, structured function/custom tool calls,
tool results, cached-token usage, and cancellation. Unsupported Responses-only
items produce a clear error. Chat Completions has no stored Responses-ID
continuation; requests retain the upstream history and rely on Lithos's prefix
cache. Generations are not automatically retried, and compaction uses upstream
local compaction through the same adapter.
